# California as an Island

For a while, people thought California was an island. The Spanish figured out the Baja Peninsula by the late 1500s, but the British and Dutch copied old Spanish maps and insisted it was an island until the 1700s.

Here's a Dutch map from 1672:

And a British map from 1700 by Herman Moll:

Moll once said, "Of course California is an Island. I have had in this office mariners who have sailed round it."

I [used Mapwarper](https://mapwarper.net/maps/44894) to georectify [this Dutch map published by Vinckeboons in 1672](https://loc.gov/resource/g3291s.mf000074/?r=0.107,0.062,0.954,0.502,0) to get the coast to line up, and took some liberties with masking the new coastline to the east of California. I added coastal features, along with what I assume are ports. And for fun I added the existing road network.
