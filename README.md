# California as an Island

For a while, people thought California was an island thanks to Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo and his 1510 romance novel, "Las sergas de Esplandián". 

_Know, that on the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California very close to the side of the Terrestrial Paradise; and it is peopled by black women, without any man among them, for they live in the manner of Amazons._

The Spanish ran into Baja California in 1533, and by sailing and walking around they figured out it was a peninsula by 1539 (thanks to Cortes, and Ulloa, who found the mouth of the Colorado river). This world map was published in Spain in 1552 and got it (and most of the world) pretty much right! Good work, [Francisco López de Gómara the cartographer](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/zw996zy2690)!

1606: California get labeled, and it's a peninsula.

But the Spanish started second guessing themselves in the early 1600s. What seems most likely is that the Spanish _wanted_ California to be an island, because it meant that any claim by Sir Francis Drake, who probably landed in California in 1579 (but completely missed San Francisco Bay thanks to Karl the Fog), any English claims to "New Albion" were invalid. 

When Juan de Oñate, the Spanish governor of New Mexico came down the Colorado River in 1605, he and his friends though they saw the Gulf of Mexico extending up to the northwest. Also, garbled stories of Juan de Fuca and the straight he discovered in 1592 (aka Vancouver Island) may given people the idea of a northern passage. And the myth thanks to that romance novel was strong. 

Here's the first known map of California as an island in 1622, published in Holland.

Maps were often state secrets, and it seems that the [Dutch ~stole~ copied old Spanish maps](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/9917574) and the British ~stole~ copied those, and insisted it was an island until the 1700s. 

This map published in London in 1625 is the first known map in English with California as an island.

It has a pretty awesome inscription.

This implies there were secret Spanish maps with California as an island floating around (like, literally, taken from captured ships) which makes you wonder if this was a giant disinformation game being played by Spain to invalidate Sir Francis Drake...

Not to be outdone, [Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_de_Herrera_y_Tordesillas), a Spanish historian who published a history of Americas in 1601 with this map of California as a peninsula...

...published a map of California as an island in a reprint of his book in 1622, via Colijn.

Here's a Dutch map from 1672:

And a British map from 1700 by Herman Moll:

Moll once said, "Of course California is an Island. I have had in this office mariners who have sailed round it."

There's an entire collection of California as an island maps over at the [Stanford Library](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/zb871zd0767).


I [used Mapwarper](https://mapwarper.net/maps/44894) to georectify [this Dutch map published by Vinckeboons in 1672](https://loc.gov/resource/g3291s.mf000074/?r=0.107,0.062,0.954,0.502,0) to get the coast to line up, and took some liberties with masking the new coastline to the east of California. I added coastal features, along with what I assume are ports. And for fun I added the existing road network.
